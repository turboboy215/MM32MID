Song Pointer List
=======================================
Like Mega Man 1, music and sound effects are stored in the same way, and are accessed via the same pointer table. This pointer table can be found with the following instructions:

    add a
    add low[SongTable]
    ld l, a
    ld a, high[SongTable]
    adc $00
    ld h, a
    ld a, [hl+]
    ld h, [hl]
    ld l, a

Which equals the following in hex:
87 C6 ?? 6F 3E ?? CE 00 67 2A 66 6F

Another variant for Mega Man 4/5:
87 C6 ?? 6F 3E ?? CE 00 67 F1 2A 66 6F

Song Format
=======================================
Each "song" starts with two bytes, the first being a binary "mask" defining which channels are used, and the second being of uncertain use. Following that is 16-bit pointers to each channel's sequence (if each is present).

1 (1): Channel mask (1234 1234 = SFX channels, then music channels)
2 (1): Music/SFX flag? (0 = SFX, 1 = Music)
3 (2): Channel 1 pointer
4 (2): Channel 2 pointer
5 (2): Channel 3 pointer
6 (2): Channel 4 pointer

Commands
=======================================
Each channel's sequence is comprised of the following commands:

xy = Play note, length
Cx = Rest
Da bb cc dd ee (ff gg) = Set channel/instrument parameters (channel 1 and 2) - ee is signed; if positive, does not include the last two bytes
Da bb cc dd = Set channel/instrument parameters (channel 3)
Da = Set channel speed (channel 4) (In Bionic Commando, Da bb cc dd ee with additional parameters)
Ex = Set octave
E8 xx = Change noise?
E9 xx = Change instrument parameter?
EA xx = Modulate sweep frequency?
EB xx = Change vibrato?
EC xx = Set channel transpose
ED xx = ?
EE xx (yy zz) = Turn on sweep?
EF xx = Set pitch tuning
F0 xx = Set noise envelope?
F1 xx = Set noise frequency?
F2 xx = Change envelope
F3 xx = Set echo?
F4 xx = Noise sweep?
F5 xx = ?
F6 xx = Change channel speed
F7 = Jump to position (1)
F8 = Jump to position (2)
F9 = Return from jump (1)
FA = Return from jump (2)
FB = Start of loop?
FC = Song loop point?
FD xx = Loop section amount of times (0 = infinite)
FE xx = Loop entire song amount of times? (0 = infinite)
FF = End track

Notes are stored in essentially the same format as Mega Man 2, using values 0-B from the first four bits to represent a note, alternating between octaves, and the last four bits for the length.
